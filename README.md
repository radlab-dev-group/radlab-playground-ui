# radlab-playground-ui
radlab‑playground‑ui is a Streamlit‑based interactive playground that lets users explore information about graph datasets, browse generated news, interact with generative chat models, and monitor system status. All UI elements are localisation‑aware, so the interface can be presented in multiple languages with a single configuration step.
